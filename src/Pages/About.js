            <p>
                A world in which anyone can create their future. Our vision is one that strives to connect our African people to the future they envision for themselves. This is the goal in front of us and it keeps us striving for more. Simply put…we will know we are succeeding when people working in tech in Africa have the same earning potential as their global counterparts possessing the same aptitude and mindset.

            <h2>OUR JOURNEY</h2>
            <p>
                In 2014, Moringa School launched its maiden Software Development class in Kenya with a cohort of only four (4) students and a vision for “A world in which anyone can create their future”. At that time, there was a growing demand for skilled tech talent as companies increased investment in technology to gain a competitive advantage from their own digital transformation. This demand was not being met by the available local talent due to a lack of skills…Something had to be done! Through the introduction of its 5-6 month Software Development, Data Science, Product Design, and Cyber Security Bootcamps, Moringa School embarked on a journey that would integrate over 7,000+ learners from diverse backgrounds and experiences while channeling their motivation to learn and grow through market-aligned curriculum, a learning approach that simulates practical on-the-job-experience, and a vibrant community of employer partners, higher learning institutions, and other industry stakeholders. This approach ensured that graduating students were prepared to take up their rightful place in the digital economy evidenced by the EdTech leader’s employment rate of 70% for all job-seeking alumni within 12 months.
